# Adhichain
<p>The main objective of Adhichain is to accept transactions from accounts, update their state and maintain this state as current state till another transaction updates it again. The whole process of accepting, executing and writing transactions can be divided into two phases in Adhichain. There is a decoupling between when a transaction is accepted by Adhichain and when the transaction is executed and written to the ledger. This decoupling is quite important for decentralization and distributed architecture to work as expected.</p>

<p>Adhichain helps primarily in three different ways</p>

<p>1. <strong>Trust</strong> — Adhichain helps in creating applications that are decentralized and collectively owned by multiple people. No body within this group has the power to change or delete previous transactions. Even if someone tries to do so, it will not be accepted by other stakeholders.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Autonomy</strong> — There is no single owner for Adhichain based applications. No one controls the Adhichain, but everyone participates into its activities. This helps in creating solutions that cannot be manipulated or induce corruption.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Integrity</strong> — The state and transactions are secured cryptographically and cannot be modified easily.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Intermediaries</strong> — Adhichain based application can help remove the intermediaries from existing processes. Generally, there is a central body like Vehicle registration, licence issuing etc who act as registrar for registering vehicles as well as issuing driver licences. Without Adhichain based systems, there is no central body and if a licence is issued or vehicle is registered after Adhichain mining process, that will remain a fact for epoch time-period without the need of any central authority vouching for it.</p>

<p>Adhichain is heavily depended on Cryptography technologies</p>
